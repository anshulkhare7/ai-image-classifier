# Smart AI Vision

Smart AI Vision is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that performs **celebrity face recognition** using a custom-trained AI model. The application can analyze images from a live camera feed or uploaded files to identify faces of specific celebrities.

## Live Demo

You can try out a live version of Smart AI Vision [here](https://anshulkhare7.github.io/ai-image-classifier/).

- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

## How to Use

### 1. Initial Loading

- Open the application and wait for the custom AI model to load
- Status message will show "Loading custom AI model... Please wait"
- Once loaded: "✅ Custom AI model loaded! Ready to analyze images."
- Camera and Gallery buttons will become active

### 2. Camera Mode

- Click **📸 Camera** button
- Grant camera permissions when prompted
- Point camera at a person's face
- Click **✨ Analyze** to capture and analyze the image
- Results will show the detected celebrity with confidence score
- Use **❌ Stop** to exit camera mode or **🗑️ Clear** to reset

### 3. Gallery Upload

- Click **🖼️ Gallery** button
- Select an image file (JPEG, PNG, WebP supported)
- Image will automatically be analyzed after loading
- Results display immediately with celebrity identification
- Use **🗑️ Clear** to reset and try another image

### 4. Understanding Results

Results display:

- **Celebrity Name**: Donald Trump, Tom Cruise, or Bill Gates
- **Confidence Score**: Percentage indicating model certainty
- **Alternative Predictions**: Other possibilities with lower confidence scores
- **🎯 Icon**: Indicates custom model prediction

- **v2.0.0 - Yamuna** - Custom Teachable Machine celebrity recognition model
- **v1.0.0 - Ganga** - Initial PWA release with multiple AI models (COCO-SSD, FaceMesh, MobileNet)

## Release Naming

This project follows an **Indian river naming convention** for releases, starting with sacred rivers:

- v1.0.0 - **Ganga** (The most sacred river)
- v2.0.1 - **Betwa** (Sacred tributary)
- v2.0.0 - **Yamuna** (Sacred tributary of Ganga)
- Future: Saraswati, Narmada, Godavari, Kaveri...

## Model Limitations

⚠️ **Current Model Constraints**:

- **Limited to 3 celebrities**: Only trained on Donald Trump, Tom Cruise, and Bill Gates
- **Small dataset**: 30 images per class (90 total training images)
- **Lighting conditions**: Performance may vary with different lighting
- **Face angles**: Works best with frontal face views
- **Image quality**: Higher resolution images generally yield better results

## Future Enhancements

- 🔄 Expand training dataset with more images
- 👥 Add more classes
- 🎯 Improve model accuracy with data augmentation
- 📊 Add prediction confidence visualization
- 🔄 Model versioning and easy switching between different trained models

## Privacy & Data

- ✅ **No data collection**: Images are processed entirely on your device
- ✅ **No server uploads**: All AI inference happens in your browser
- ✅ **No tracking**: No analytics or user behavior tracking
- ✅ **Open source**: Complete transparency in code and functionality

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome 88+ (recommended)
