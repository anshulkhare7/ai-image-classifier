# Smart AI Vision

Smart AI Vision is a web-based application that uses artificial intelligence to perform object and face detection. It can analyze images from a live camera feed or from an uploaded file.

## Features

- **Real-time Object and Face Detection:** Utilizes your device's camera to detect objects and faces in real-time.
- **Image Upload Analysis:** Allows you to upload image files (JPEG, PNG, etc.) for object and face detection.
- **AI-Powered:** Leverages TensorFlow.js to run multiple pre-trained machine learning models directly in your browser:
    - **COCO-SSD:** For detecting a wide variety of common objects.
    - **FaceMesh:** For detailed face detection and landmark tracking.
    - **MobileNet:** As a fallback for general image classification.
- **Confidence Scores:** Displays the detected objects or faces along with a confidence score for each prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive controls for starting the camera, uploading images, and viewing results.
- **Client-Side Processing:** All image processing and AI analysis happen directly in your web browser, ensuring privacy as your images are not uploaded to a server.

## How to Use

1.  **Initial State:**
    *   When you first open the application, it will begin loading the necessary AI models. During this time, the "Camera" and "Gallery" buttons will be disabled.
    *   A status message "Loading AI models... Please wait" will be displayed.
    *   Once the models are loaded, a success message "‚úÖ All AI models loaded! Ready to analyze images." will appear, and the "Camera" and "Gallery" buttons will become active.

2.  **Using the Camera:**
    *   Click the "üì∏ Camera" button.
    *   Your browser will likely ask for permission to access your camera. Grant the permission.
    *   Your camera feed will appear in the preview area.
    *   The controls will change to "‚ú® Analyze" and "‚ùå Stop".
    *   Point your camera at the objects or faces you want to detect.
    *   Click the "‚ú® Analyze" button. This will capture a still photo from the camera feed.
    *   The application will then analyze this photo, and the results will be displayed below.
    *   After analysis, or if you want to stop the camera feed, click the "‚ùå Stop" button. This will deactivate the camera and show the initial "Camera" and "Gallery" buttons. You can also click "üóëÔ∏è Clear" to remove the current image and results.

3.  **Uploading an Image from Gallery:**
    *   Click the "üñºÔ∏è Gallery" button.
    *   Your device's file selector will open. Choose an image file (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
    *   The selected image will be displayed in the preview area.
    *   The application will automatically start analyzing the image.
    *   The results will be displayed below.
    *   After viewing the results, you can click "üóëÔ∏è Clear" to remove the image and results, or upload another image using the "üñºÔ∏è Gallery" button, or switch to the "üì∏ Camera".

4.  **Viewing Results:**
    *   Detected objects or faces will be shown in result cards under the "üîç What I found:" section.
    *   Each card displays:
        *   An icon representing the object/face.
        *   The name of the detected object (e.g., "Cat", "Human Face", "Laptop").
        *   A confidence score (e.g., "92% confident").
        *   Sometimes, additional information like other detected objects might be listed.

5.  **Clearing Results/Resetting:**
    *   If an image is displayed (either from camera capture or gallery upload), the "üóëÔ∏è Clear" button will be visible.
    *   Clicking "üóëÔ∏è Clear" will remove the current image from the preview, clear any displayed analysis results, and reset the view to the initial placeholder.
